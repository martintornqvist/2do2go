    <h2>It's easy!</h2>
    <p>
      You just have to click on the 'Make a list' button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then add the things you want to have on the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you hit the 'Share' button it creates an unique URL for you to share to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viewer (who recieves the shared URL) is still able to edit and delete items from that specific list.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      And the best part?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you already shared the URL and want to add something to the list - go ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
      It will update the viewers list automatically!
